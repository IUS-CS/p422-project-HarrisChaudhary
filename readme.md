# Calendar

For my Project in P422, I will develop a Calendar on which you can add/view events. My program will save the events/data entered on each specific date and will highlight how many events were saved on each specific date. 
What I plan to have done by the end of the semester is to have a calendar that saves events on days you select and displays months and years to come. My program's interface would be simple to use with one side displaying the 
calendar, and the other side displaying the area from which you can view/add your events. I will use Angular CLI in WebStorm to develop this program. Languages I will use are TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI].
